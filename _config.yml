  description: I am a senior software engineer at Google Zurich. I received my Ph.D. in 2019 from Paderborn University, and my M.Sc. in Computer Science in 2014 from EPFL. <br /> My research interests are scalable static code analysis, usable tooling, and secure software engineering. In particular, I explored the usability of static analysis tools, from the optimization of the analysis algorithms to the implementation of their frameworks to the usability of their interfaces.
