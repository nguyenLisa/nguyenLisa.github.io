Static analysis tools have well-documented usability issues. In this project, we explore how to build analysis tools that help code developers understand and fix complex bugs, and how to engage them with a comprehensive, user-friendly GUI.

We achieve this by applying gaming aspects to analysis tools. More than providing a pretty user interface, we aim at improving the analysis tooling system as a whole, providing immediate and clear feedback, and focusing on fixing bugs rather than listing them.
