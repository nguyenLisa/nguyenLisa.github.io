Current static-analysis tools are often long-running, which causes them to be sidelined into nightly build checks. As a result, developers rarely use such tools to detect bugs when writing code, because they disrupt their workflow.

In this paper, we present Cheetah, a static taint analysis tool for Android apps that interleaves bug fixing and code development in the Eclipse integrated development environment. Cheetah is based on the novel concept of Just-in-Time static analysis that discovers and reports the most relevant results to the developer fast, and computes the more complex results incrementally later. Unlike traditional batch-style static-analysis tools, Cheetah causes minimal disruption to the developer's workflow.
