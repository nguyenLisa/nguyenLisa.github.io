This article explores the effect of applying a user-centered approach to SWAN, a security-focused static-analysis tool for the Swift programming language. SWAN is being actively developed to feature better integration into the Swift development workflow. Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach and guidelines for improving the usability of the next version of SWAN.
